The transmission of commensal bacteria can occur through physical contact and cohabitation, as well as through the consumption of water contaminated with fecal microorganisms. In both scenarios, the transfer of commensal microbes may have significant implications for health. An improved understanding of microbial transfers will provide valuable insights for the development of probiotics and the use of fecal microbiota transfers in disease treatment. The use of allo-coprophagy in rats is a good model for investigating the transmission dynamics of commensal microbes. Allo-coprophagy refers to a naturally occurring process observed in rodents, where an individual consumes the feces of another individual belonging to the same species. Consequently, this leads to the transfer of microbes from one animal to another. The objective of this study is to detect and quantify allo-coprophagy in outbred laboratory rats, in order to understand the transmission of microorganisms facilitated by allo-coprophagy. This work is based on the concept that the cells and DNA seen in a rat’s gut are derived from its own DNA and the DNA coming from its cage mate’s feces as a result of the shedding of the cage mate’s gut epithelial cells consumed through allo-coprophagy and identified via sequencing. In this study, we extracted DNA from the gut of 32 pair-housed rats belonging to the "heterogeneous stock" (HS) rats using deep shotgun sequencing and utilized only the reads that aligned to the rat reference genome. Pre-existing statistical methodologies[1] were employed to detect and quantify instances of DNA mixtures. An additional statistical analysis was conducted in order to ascertain if the observed mixture was a result of contamination and/or allo-coprophagy. One rat was identified to possess a substantial amount of cage mate DNA in its gut. However, when considering the entire dataset of 32 experimental rats, the data supporting allo-coprophagy was not statistically significant. This study shows the possibility of employing deep shotgun sequencing of the gut as a means to quantitatively assess a process that plays a crucial role in the transmission of microbes across individuals.
